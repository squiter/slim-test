# Slim Test
This it a small project that I made to test [Slim Framework](http://www.slimframework.com/). A PHP micro framework that works like Sinatra for Ruby.  
In this same project, I've been testing [PHP-ActiveRecord](http://www.phpactiverecord.org/).  

Reference: [Using PHPActiveRecord with Slim Framework](http://silentworks.co.uk/blog/development/using-phpactiverecord-with-slim-framework.html).
